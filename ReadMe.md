# Week 2 Lab: System Verilog

Exhaustive Tests
    Pros:   Tests all possible inputs and ensures full functionalities of all cases
    Cons:   Takes longer to test all cases which makes testing less efficient

Sampling Tests
    Pros:   Tests for important functionality in a program and allows for confirmation essential cases
    Cons:   May miss edge cases 

Random Testing
    Pros:   Efficient and may randomly address certain edge cases missed 
    Cons:   May miss edge cases as well as cases important to certain functionalities
